WavCapInOut V2 : code for pcm wave in and wave out processing with OpenAL with minimal "clicks" in the soundstream. This code was meant for a speech algorithm with a neural network I'm currently working on.

Build 2v2 : program contains a complete 3D engine and a standard ANN (artificial back-propagation neural network)
